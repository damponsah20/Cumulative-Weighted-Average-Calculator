Welcome to the institution where the enigma of knowledge is unlocked solely by the discerning.

You must feel a sense of accomplishment having secured admission to the prestigious Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST).


Your dedication and fervor have indeed borne fruit, but your journey of diligence is far from over. Now that you have been granted entry, it’s natural to harbor inquiries about the institution, particularly with regard to The KNUST Grading System.

WHAT CONSTITUTES THE KNUST GRADING SYSTEM?
The KNUST Grading System is formally referred to as the Cumulative Weighted Average (CWA).

CWA, in essence, is a system of evaluation determined by computing a student’s mean performance across all subjects within a given course.


Typically, KNUST assessments allocate 70% of the grade to examinations, while the remaining 30% is derived from a student’s participation in school-related activities, encompassing practical work, mid-semester evaluations, assignments, research projects, punctuality, group collaborations, and other factors contingent on the specific course and the lecturer’s discretion in evaluating performance.

This summation results in a total of 100%.

The computation of CWA hinges on the marks assigned and the credit weighting they carry.

Initially, students begin their first semester with a CWA of 100.00.


Subsequently, as they progress through the semester’s examination schedule, their weighted average is recalculated to ascertain their cumulative score. The KNUST Grading System adheres to the following scale:

 

CLASS

First-class

70 and above

Second class-upper

69.99 – 60.00
